          <h2>Adobe Photoshop Elements 2020 Review: Minor Improvements to a Great Photo Editor</h2>
          <h3>Adobe Photoshop Elements is the best consumer photo-editing software for Mac users.</h3>
          <p>
            Adobe Photoshop Elements 2020 has some nice additions, but the upgrade isn't compelling for those who purchased Elements in the last few years. On the other hand, if you're looking to buy a new photo-editing program, PS Elements is great for novice photographers who want to learn imaging, anyone who wants to quickly edit and share their photos, and many serious photographers seeking powerful creative tools. Windows users might be better off with Corel PaintShop Pro, which offers more functionality for serious photographers and therefore more growth potential for novices. However, PaintShop Pro is Windows-only, whereas PS Elements works on both Macs and PCs, making it accessible for a larger group.

          <h2>Minecraft’s recent surge on YouTube proves that the ‘PewDiePie Effect’ is still real</h2>
          <h3>A term from five years ago is relevant again.</h3>
          <p>
            Almost two months ago, Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg did something his fans have wanted for years: he made a Minecraft video, and he’s continued to make them ever since. The result was Kjellberg’s most successful month in years, pulling in more than 570 million views in July and kickstarting a new trend among some of the biggest YouTube creators. Those 570 million views in July also translate to Kjellberg making money from his recent Minecraft obsession. The ability to earn more may be a driving factor for other creators who are jumping on the trend and hoping that the trickle-down effect will boost their income.

            Minecraft right now is proof that the “PewDiePie Effect,” a term coined five years ago, is still very much a phenomenon on YouTube.

          <h2>Beirut art spaces close en-masse as huge anti-government protests take over the city</h2>
          <h3>Artists and institutions come out in support of protestors who are demanding political reforms in Lebanon</h3>
          <p>
            Art institutions and galleries have closed “until further notice” as the largest demonstrations in decades grip Beirut and other cities in Lebanon, with protestors demanding political reforms. The upheaval, which saw a reported two million people demonstrating across the country on Sunday (the country's population is around six million), have led to the temporary closure of the Beirut Art Center, Dar El-Nimer, Sfeir-Semler Gallery and the Sursock Museum, which has just opened a major Picasso exhibition with works on loan from the Musée Picasso in Paris. Protests have spilled into the many abandoned, government-owned buildings such as the Grand Theatre, which has been closed to the public since the civil war ended in 1990. "What a beautiful building kept from the people," says Nat Muller, an independent curator who is visiting Beirut and witnessed the demonstrations. In a Facebook post on Saturday she commented that the protests "have been festive and in good spirits with people from all walks of life participating. The Lebanese have much to protest against. Here's to revolution and to a change for the better."

            Lebanon's prime minister Saad Hariri announced on Friday that he has proposed economic reforms and given his coalition partners in government 72 hours to approve them. He is expected to give a speech about the outcome later today.
